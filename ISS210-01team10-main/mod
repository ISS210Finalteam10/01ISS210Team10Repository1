                <!-- Why Stereotyping Matters -->
                <p class="masthead-subheading font-weight-light mb-0">Stereotyping matters because it's able to affect mental health.
                    Stereotyping is a natural tenendcy. 
                 Stereotyping is an assumption about an individual or a group . 
                    A stereotype can be postitve or negative, though negative stereotypes are the most commomn.
                     Making a stereotype about someone or a group another ultimatley labels their identity as one thing. 
                Stereotyping limits a person or a group to a single story about themeselves.
                These single stories can affect ones mental health, depending on the serveity of the stereotype that was made.
                Stereotypes can cause people to develop mental illnesses like depression, anxiety disorders, and personailty disorders. </p>

                <div class="container"><p>According to MyJove Corporation, the definiton of a stereotype is the specific belief or assumption about individuals based solely on their membership in a particular group.
                This can include things like microagressions or biases that are unintentionally misrepresenting a certain group. Stereotypes tend to be negative which leads to prejudice, a negative attitude or feeling to the group being stereotyped.
                Prejudice can lead to an individual doing harmful actions to those are stereotypicalized. This is known as discrimination, which is the negative actions towards an individual being stereotyped. 
                Stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination all come from the origin of social learning as one learns how to act upon social norms. 
                This can include the exmaple of children or training individuals learning prejudiced beliefs from their parents, teachers, or those in Supreme Power. 
                The usage of mainstream media like the news or social media also plays a huge role in impacting the way people perceive stereotypes. </p>

Try to have these six containers provide a mix of calls to action and literature to support your cause. For instance, if you can find a local organization to call/volunteer/donate/etc., you may want to put their information in one of these containers. Likewise, your image may be a phone. The title of this image may be their organization. In the space where this is all typed, you will talk about them. If they are an organization, you may include their mission statement or their spokesperson or representative image. If it is literature, be sure to include significant evidence here. You may want to pull a quote (if you do, include in-text citation) and you may want to pull a photo of scholar/speaker from the internet.

                                    <p class="mb-4">This video discusses the negative effects of slum tourism in postapartheid Africa. Meghan Muldoon, the speaker, 
				    explains her experiences while in Africa and how we view ourselves as educated and civilized compared to those who live in stereotypically 
				    impoverished nations. She also discusses how colonialism still impacts the nation today and how sterotypes and slum tourism negatively impacts 
				    people and how they percieve themselves and others.
                                    Media often depics people as how they want others to percieve them. In this case, media wants to depict images or videos of people who, visually, 
				    are in less fortunate situations. This ultimately harms these individuals and further allows the perpetrations of stereotyping. By showing specific 
				    races or ethnicities of people in "impoverished" locations, the media spreads these stereotypes in a larger scale, which further divides people because
				    of these perceptions.</p>

<p>In this example I am exploring the short story titled “Pink for Girls and Blue for Boys”.  As a young boy grows up, he begins to wonder why the things he was given were so much different than what his parents gave to his sister.
For example, he was fascinated by dolls because they reminded him of his sister and his mother.  He also loved playing cook with his sister.
The boy’s parents would instead give him toothbrushes with cars on them and a water bottle with a rocket on it, however, they did not catch his interest.He instead liked the pink toothbrush because it reminded him of his sister. He would become confused and upset when his parents would instead give him other toys and objects
From this story, we can infer that the boy’s parents assumed his interests because of his gender.  His parents are stereotypical of their son. 
Maybe the boy will grow up to realize that he identifies more as a female.  
Maybe the boy just has a strong bond to his sister or mother.  
Or maybe he simply has his own interests that would not stereotypically fit into the interests of most boys, according to his parents<p>

Try to have these six containers provide a mix of calls to action and literature to support your cause. For instance, if you can find a local organization to call/volunteer/donate/etc., you may want to put their information in one of these containers. Likewise, your image may be a phone. The title of this image may be their organization. In the space where this is all typed, you will talk about them. If they are an organization, you may include their mission statement or their spokesperson or representative image. If it is literature, be sure to include significant evidence here. You may want to pull a quote (if you do, include in-text citation) and you may want to pull a photo of scholar/speaker from the internet.

In the 14 of 14,632 articles which met inclusion criteria for the discrimination, four showed all-cause mortality, four showed cause-specific mortality, and four showed birth problems (Michaels et al. Paragraph 1). The hazards include diabetes, high blood pressure, miscarriage, etc. Also, “All studies found a positive association between area-level racial prejudice and adverse health outcomes among racial/ethnic minoritized groups, with four studies also showing a similar association among Whites” (Michaels et al. Paragraph 1). The discrimination cause mental pressure and massive stress to victims.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Inequality causes the rich and the poor to be stereotyped differently and generally more negatively. Such types of stereotypes matter as they have the potential to collectively shape motivations to reduce or maintain inequality.<br>
                                    Research on social class stereotypes has mainly focused on the Vertical dimension. Much like the name suggests in vertical stereotyping the wealthier groups have higher social status, and thus are viewed as more competent and ambitious than the middle-income groups, and the poorer groups who are considered of lower social status and are viewed as lazy and incompetent.<br>
                                    Along these lines, many societies stereotype the wealthy as cold and immoral, as they may be perceived as acquiring their wealth through illegitimate and selfish means. However, the poor are generally perceived as friendlier and more moral than the wealthy, even though this is not always the case.<br>
                                    It’s usually the poor that suffers through the negative stereotypes, but in some cases even the rich can get affected due the mistrust between the two social classes. For example, the wealthy become fearful of falling while the poor experience enhanced relative deprivation, this can lead to conflicts between the two groups.<br>
                                    Since the rich is generally associated with assertive, smart, and hard-working people, its usually the rich who frames the perceptions of society (the makers), while the poor are stereotyped as lazy, not hardworking, and incompetent (the losers).<br>
                                    Negatively stereotyping affects both these social groups,it creates toxicity and intergroup prejudices.Intergroup relations between the wealthy and poor tend to be more negative and competitive in unequal societies. To the extent that it influences the stereotype content of both the social class categories, thus making both the wealthy and poor groups appear unfriendly and immoral.It leads to intergroup hostility and toxic prejudices.<br>
